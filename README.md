## Current Status
IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

Create a dentist-grade bite force sensor by adding variable force resistors in a mouthguard enclosure. The resistors are connected to a custom circuit to filter out noise and a microcontroller which displays the force to the user on a computer via graphical user interface.
## Educational Value Added

Signal processing, designing water-resistant circuits.
